  storyText: Festers. Everywhere. Armed mostly with gas-powered rock flingers. At
    least 10 of them guarding the hangar door. Typical.  Could try punching my way
    through. Or sneaking the long way to the emergency exit.  What should I do? 
    1. Take them head on - rush the 10 guards. 2. Sneak my way to the emergency exit.
